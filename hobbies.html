<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<h2>Sports</h2>
<p>I like to participate in many sports activities such as playing badminton, volleyball etc. I do participate in athletic sports like running.
    I am skilled in Taekwando that is a martial art. I have always been enthusiastic about sports and activities that require physical participation. Participating in 
    group based sports like volleyball develops team playing behavior, leadership qualities, mutual understanding, and sportsmanship. While participating in invidual 
    player sports like badminton and Taekwando motivate and want us to have wish to push ourselves more on developing our individual skill. Sports has helped me in understanding myself better and to never loose hope.It helps me in my academics as well as in coding and development too.

<h2>Cycling</h2>
<p>Cycling is my favourite hobby. When the wind touches your face it gives the feeling of freedom and energies us. The peace that i get while cycling is incomparable. Its like meditation while exploring. </p>
